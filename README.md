Hi, we're Runhead AC!

We're a friendly running club in South East London.

We run every Tuesday at 7.30 from The Old Nun's Head on Nunhead Green, in small sociable groups at paces/distances between 4 miles at 10 min/miles, and 6 mile group at 8 min/miles, then we stick around for a beer and a burger afterwards. We also do longer runs in marathon season, trail runs, trips away, brewery runs, and more! If this sounds like your kind of running club then come down soon and say hi!
